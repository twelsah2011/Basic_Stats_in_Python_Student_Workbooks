    "# Survival Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Survival analysis is the examination of how long we expect something to last or continue. For example, how long do we expect someone to live after a certain diagnosis, how long we expect a customer to remain a customer, or how long we expect someone to remain at a job. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Survive](images/survive.gif \"Survive\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Survival analysis is another way we can use our distribution data to make projections, or inferences, about the future. To do our survival analysis we need two key pieces of information:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> A measure of time - how long they have lasted. \n",
    "<li> An indication of the \"event\" - whenever the survival thing happens. E.g. death, a customer leaves, a lightbulb fails. \n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have a dataset that shows us how long until an event happens for the records in our sample, we can create a distribution from that data to estimate the time to event, and we can do some manipulations of that data to create some survival specific tools and techniques. A\n",
    "\n",
    "### Type of Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "We will do some univariate survival analysis, or we will use one variable - the time somemthing lasts. The event varaible is more of an indication that the time something lasts is now over, it isn't really it's own feature. It is possible, though a bit more complex, to do survival analysis with a larger feature set, just like regression/classification. The lifelines package referenced near the bottom of the workbook provides some tools for this, we <i>may</i> get into it during the ML stuff, largely dependent on what we need to cover for your project work.

Just like the PDF shows the value at any given point, and the CDF shows the cumulative total, the hazard function shows the probability of \"the event\" at any given point, and the survival function shows the cumulative total. The hazard function can also be described as the \"instantaneous likelihood of failure\" - the probability that it dies at that moment.

For example, the hazard function will show: of all employees that lasted 24 months, how many ended their employment in that month. We can draw a line to make the connection a bit more clear on the chart. Our data has the time interval in months, so the value of each point on the chart is \"events in this month\". "

    "### Censorship\n",
    "\n",
    "One concept that also comes up when looking at survival is the idea of censored data - in short, censored data is data that we don't have \"all\" of. Specifically in survival analysis, censored data is any data for which we do not know the exact event time. There are three types of censored data; right censored, left censored, and interval cesored. Data for which the exact event time is known is referred to as complete data. In general, our concern with censoring will be right censored data, generally due to items where the event hasn't happened yet. For things like a drug trial, if we are tracking how long patients live, we (hopefully) have a bunch where we don't know the true answer, because they are still alive, we jst know they lived \"at least up to this point\". In general, this type of data is common for things that use survival analysis - think about a drug trial, if the drug works, we probably don't want to wait 70 years for everyone involved to die before being able to analyze the data and approve the drug. As well, people will commonly do things like stop working with the people conducting the trial, move away to a different city, etc...\n",
    "\n",
    "![Right Censor](images/right_censor.png \"Right Censor\")\n",
    "\n",
    "For us, we will not be doing extensive survival analysis, so it is good enough to be aware of what censored data is, should it become important for something you may be working on. The KM estimation is able to produce estimations that account for the right censored data that we often get in survival analysis. Exactly how to handle censored data beyond this is generally a domain specific thing, depending on exactly what you're analyzing. \n",

The test itself is internally a Chi2 test. We won't get into the details of lifelines here, but the log-rank test is effectively like a t-test that we did with distributions, it will generate a p-value that we can use to determine if we have evidence to say the cohorts are different from each other. There is an example of this test at the bottom of this workbook using the lifelines package, it is pretty simple to use and understand with our experience with hypothesis tests. "
